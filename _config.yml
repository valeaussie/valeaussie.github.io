  Hi, I’m Valentina, an astrophysicist with a genuine love for statistics
  (yes, I truly love statistics, don’t hold it against me)!<br>
  
  I am currently a Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne, working with Professor <a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6505-andrew-melatos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Melatos</a>.<br>
  
  I recently completed a PhD in Astrophysics, with a thesis titled
  "Towards Rigorous Inference of Nanohertz Gravitational Waves",
  supervised by <a href="https://ethrane.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Eric Thrane</a>, 
  <a href="https://experts.swinburne.edu.au/3635-ryan-shannon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Ryan Shannon</a>, 
  and <a href="https://andrewzic.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr Andrew Zic.<br>
  
  Before that, I completed an MPhil in Statistics with a thesis titled
  "Novel Approach to the Reconstruction of Partially Detected Evolving Systems",
  under the supervision of <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jonathan-keith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associate Professor Jonathan Keith</a> 
  and <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/k.mengersen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Distinguished Professor Kerrie Mengersen</a>
  (available <a href="https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Novel_Approach_to_the_Reconstruction_of_Partially_Detected_Evolving_Systems/19172537?file=34065434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).<br>

  I also have over 18 years of experience in digital marketing.
